### What is Audio.js?
Audio.js is a collection of audio-related projects for JavaScript.  They mostly revolve around the central `Audio` object.

### What is `Audio` (audiojs/audio)?
`Audio` is an object that stores a sample, sample rate, bit depth, and some methods for easier audio manipulation.  It is a PCM object where you can read and write pulse data.

### What is this for?
It allows audio to be scriptable through JavaScript.  Audio conversion to and from any formats can be done easily through this middleman object.  You can also manipulate audio with algorithmic functions or writing raw pulse data.
